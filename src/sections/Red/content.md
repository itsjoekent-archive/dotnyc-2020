I know litigating this presidency is painful, but we need to do it one more time.

{{END_TRUMP}}

...and during all of it they made [millions of dollars in profits off of the American taxpayer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ballrooms-candles-and-luxury-cottages-during-trumps-term-millions-of-government-and-gop-dollars-have-flowed-to-his-propertiesmar-a-lago-charged-the-government-3-apiece-for-glasses-of-water-for-trump-and-the-japanese-leader/2020/10/27/186f20a2-1469-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html). You would think that this leader would be crushed so badly at the ballot box for being one of the dumbest anti-American presidents in history. They would have no chance but to flee the country in shame to one of their private golf-resorts overseas or risk having their head put on a stick by the masses.

Alas, America did not fully reject any of this. Yes, Biden won the popular vote, *thank god*. But over 74 million people voted for more of *this*. That is an unfathomably large number of Americans and I don’t think we’ve fully grasped the enormity of that figure. That is more votes than what Obama received in ‘08, ‘12, and what Hillary received in ‘16. There is a level of mass-brainwashing that has happened in America and we don’t have a clear path to undoing it.

I am personally still stuck with the image of a relative of mine wearing a “Trump 2020” pin on his suit jacket to my *grandfather's funeral in December 2020*. Sure, his behavior is [not quite as bad as plotting to kidnap a Democratic governor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-militia.html), or [blowing up a telecommunications building because of wild conspiracies](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2020/12/30/nashville-chirstmas-bombing-conspiracy-theories/4075566001/), but the wires inside the brains of even the average MAGA voter are clearly discombobulated.

Tens of millions of people, for a wide variety of reasons, voted for a party that is outright barbaric in nature. One example that never escapes my mind is how the Republican party on [numerous occasions has tried to deny the first responders of 9/11 healthcare coverage](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/how-lawmakers-protected-and-failed-9-11-first-responders.html) for life saving cancer treatments, and this year the [Trump administration tried to take money out of their healthcare fund](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/nyc-should-replace-9-11-funds-erroneously-taken-by-treasury-mnuchin-tells-de-blasio/ar-BB19SiF0). How much more evil can a political party be than to block lifesaving money from going to firefighters? And yet, America, the country that claims to love its first responders (*[we just don't care how our actions impact their mental health](https://mhanational.org/mental-health-healthcare-workers-covid-19), or [god forbid they need side income because they don't make a living wage](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-emt-lauren-kwei-1103336/)*), resoundingly voted for *that barbaric party* to stay in legislative power.

And then there are the conspiracies.

An old gaming friend of mine this summer popped up in a small Discord server I often frequent with other pals from our past gaming community. This old gaming friend started posting COVID conspiracies, and it was clear he had been “[redpilled](https://www.wired.com/story/kanye-west-red-pill/)”. Soon, he went from posting links about fake COVID death rates to full-on QAnon “drops”.

I desperately tried every tactic imaginable for weeks, patiently trying to help break whatever spell he was caught under. Eventually, the community set a rule posting these insane conspiracies were no longer tolerated, and he rage quit the server. I posted a brief remark about the experience on Twitter, and at least half a dozen people reached out to me that night alone sharing similar experiences with people in their lives that were similarly brainwashed with deranged right-wing conspiracies. I had nothing to offer them other than giving them the comfort that I too was completely hopeless about what to do.

I wish this was all anecdotal, but a poll conducted in October found that roughly [half of Trump’s supporters believe in QAnon](https://news.yahoo.com/new-yahoo-news-you-gov-poll-half-of-trump-supporters-believe-q-anons-imaginary-claims-124025042.html), which makes sense given they [elected a QAnon believer to Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/us/politics/qanon-candidates-marjorie-taylor-greene.html). Maybe worse, several surveys have found a majority of Trump’s base [believe the November election was rigged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/half-of-republicans-say-biden-won-because-of-a-rigged-election-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Y1AJ). This conspiracy means you believe that a Democratic aligned group was able to covertly dig up lists of hundreds of thousands of dead voters in counties of swing states across America, that were still on the voter rolls, request their mail-in ballot, intercept those ballots at all of those mailboxes, filled them out for Biden but split the rest of the ticket for Republicans, and then dropped all of those ballots off without anyone questioning their truck load of ballots being offloaded. It is just absolutely preposterous and stupid to believe. And claiming a software vendor “flipped votes” that literally exist on paper ballots and can be audited by hand counting the paper votes is just as preposterous.

The wide-spread voter fraud theories are the equivalent of believing that the earth is flat. And yet, here we are nearly two months later after the election and somewhere around half of the elected Republican party is still in denial even after their attempt to secede from the union failed.

I have no idea if “QAnon” will survive post-Trump. But the breakdowns of society that have led to so many (predominantly, but not exclusively) Republican voters falling for ridiculous conspiracies, ranging from birtherism to anti-vaxxer, are not going to change overnight. The void of one conspiracy will continue to be replaced by another, thanks to all of the Murdoch's and Zuckerberg’s out there running platforms that are constantly poisoning the minds of Americans with absolute bullshit. I’m not sure what we can ever do about this.
