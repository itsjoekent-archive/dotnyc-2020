Growing up on Staten Island, I remember the day Eric Garner was killed by the police. I was 17, by no means fully versed in how systemic racism is enshrined in the foundations of our criminal justice system, but I knew intuitively in my heart his death was deeply wrong. It didn’t matter he was selling cigarettes *illegally*, or that he “*resisted arrest*.” He was a father, a man trying to provide for his family, he should not have died at the hands of the police. But I remember having a contentious debate in our *white* household about his death. And I similarly remember two years later having a contentious debate with my father, a Navy vet, about football players taking a knee in protest to police violence.

My dad does not wear a MAGA hat, and it’s hard to recall anything he’s hated more than Donald Trump. But buried inside him is the classic racial tropes that you might have heard time & time again from white America, “*I didn’t grow up rich, I don’t have white privilege*”, or, “*we need some police reform, but the Black community should work on reducing black on black crime*.” I’ve endlessly struggled to help him see the world in a more systemic, intersectional way, but I fear for many white Americans, like my dad, that the implications of this conversation are simply too large to accept, or that deep down they don’t want to accept it, because this notion of systemic racism and white privilege challenges the very core of how they’ve viewed their life.

When George Floyd was murdered this year, our household had no debate. I think America nearly universally agreed George Floyd was murdered by the police in one of the most cruel ways imaginable. [But that didn’t mean white America was ready to admit racism was still a wider problem](https://www.uml.edu/News/press-releases/2020/SocialIssuesPoll092220.aspx). My dad, like many in white America, seemed more animated about the broken windows of Macy’s on 34th street than the Kentucky Attorney General engaging in a [cover up of Breonna Taylor’s death at the hands of the police](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breonna-taylor-grand-juror-homicide-charges-police-mistakes/).

It did not matter how many videos of [brazen police violence went viral around the internet](https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1266917228752056320). It did not matter that The New York Times [compiled dozens of videos of the NYPD over a two week period](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/14/nyregion/nypd-george-floyd-protests.html) showing the department acting more like a Mafia than “*New York’s Finest*”. It did not matter that the Philadelphia SWAT team engaged in essentially [chemical warfare against civilians](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007174941/philadelphia-tear-gas-george-floyd-protests.html), or that the Buffalo police [shoved an innocent old man on the ground who did nothing wrong and cracked his head open](https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1268716877355810818). It did not matter that the US Marshals flat out [assassinated an “Antifa activist”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/michael-reinoehl-antifa-portland-shooting.html), or that a Los Angeles Sheriff Deputy [killed an innocent young 18-year old Latino as his initiation to join a cop gang](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/family-andr-s-guardado-killed-sheriff-s-deputy-files-lawsuit-n1239024). Oh and how did the police respond to the increased media interest? [They shot at the press](https://freedom.press/news/press-freedom-violations-george-floyd-protests-numbers-shocking-and-unprecedented-level-attacks-journalists/).

Yet, white people were more concerned about property damage than constraining the police state, even though it was later revealed that [right-wing protestors were conducting the bulk of the property destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/22/who-caused-violence-protests-its-not-antifa/). Regardless, [the support for Black Lives Matter among white America fell swiftly](https://www.uml.edu/News/press-releases/2020/SocialIssuesPoll092220.aspx).

For a few months this year, [especially when the unmarked federal goon squads started showing up](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/politics/unidentified-police-protests.html) and [later kidnapping people in unmarked vans](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892277592/federal-officers-use-unmarked-vehicles-to-grab-protesters-in-portland), it felt like America was on the verge of becoming an authoritarian police state. If America was a middle eastern nation, there would have been an emergency UN security council meeting and Central Command would have been devising plans to invade and overthrow the Trump regime.

But after weeks of large confrontations between activists and the police, the media cycle began to move on, social media began to return back to *normal*, and white America moved on. But policing didn’t change, months after George Floyd’s tragic murder, [police were still killing Black men at a disproportionate rate](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-killing-police-black-people-killed-164/). Most recently, [Casey Goodson Jr. was shot by police while standing at the door to his home holding a bag with a Subway sandwich](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/casey-goodson-columbus-ohio-shooting.html).

Both political parties, at every level of government, failed to enact real change. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 introduced by Democratic house leadership, which was inadequate to begin with, never even made it out of the House. The Senate also [rejected a bipartisan bill to stop retired military hardware being sold at surplus value to local police departments](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/07/21/senate-rejects-broad-limit-on-military-equipment-to-police/), equipment such as tanks and assault rifles. And almost no mayor or city council in this country found the gall to get their police in-check during the protests, push for a shift in budgetary priorities, or end [“warrior cop”](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/2/21277438/police-officer-george-floyd-patrick-skinner-interview-militarization) training.

All the while, virtually every member of the Democratic establishment [took turns dunking on Black Lives Matter activists](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/19/blm-defund-police-democrats-437940) that engaged in the political process and dared proposing something bold & transformative that made white America feel uncomfortable and have to grapple with the pain Black communities are enduring.

In the present day, I think a lot about how a white bar owner here in Staten Island recently led a COVID-19 revolt against the governor's public health mandate, and in the process ran his car into a Sheriff trying to arrest him. The sheriff wound up clinging to the hood of the car for over 300 feet and obviously had to go to the hospital, but the [suspect was released without bail](https://nypost.com/2020/12/06/si-autonomous-zone-bar-owner-released-from-custody/). Yet, just a few weeks prior on the other side of Staten Island, a person of color who even had a reputation of donating to charitable police causes and **did literally nothing wrong**, [was swarmed by over a dozen NYPD officers](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-staten-island-noise-arrest-force-allegation-nypd-20201123-utlfioizm5gaboofvt76btzjwa-story.html) outside his family deli at 12AM and forcibly arrested.

The criminal justice system remains broken, and most of the politicians remain unwilling to fix it.
