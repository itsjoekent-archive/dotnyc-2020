## <span>part four</span> next

My first draft of this essay had concluded with a long, mildly-fatalist rant about the state of politics and media. But while 2020 might have made us see some of the worst in humanity, there is no good advocating for fatalism, nihilism, or any sense that change is not possible. We cannot succumb to our worst instincts, and we must believe a better future is possible.

Or as my former boss said, nevertheless, we persist.
