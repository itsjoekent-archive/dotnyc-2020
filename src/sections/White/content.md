As an avid TikTok consumer prior to the pandemic, I was already well familiar with the phrase “Karen” where it was widely used in the comments of TikTok videos. You’d often find it in the comments of a TikTok where a white woman would pull over to yell at teenagers on skateboards for absolutely no reason, or use their car to block someone from getting out of their parking spot because she was mad at them.

{{RACIST_KAREN}}

But in 2020, “Karen” became the default label for white people being overtly angry and racist, most notably when [a white woman was caught making a false 911 call about a black man](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/nyregion/central-park-amy-cooper-christian-racism.html) in Central Park. The viral video showed how white America felt about Black America, and how white America viewed the police as a tool of oppression that they could wield at will. Videos of “Karen’s”, white women perpetuating overtly-obvious racism, started popping up everywhere. [*“Is this your property?”*](https://twitter.com/jaimetoons/status/1271300265170186240) a white woman asks before calling the police on a person of color stenciling “Black Lives Matter” onto their sidewalk.

The pandemic brought an entire new dimension to “Karen”.

{{ANTI_MASK_KAREN}}

[*“Anyone who is harassing me to wear a mask, you are violating federal laws”*](https://twitter.com/mistergeezy/status/1276733850740240384), says Karen completely maskless in Trader Joes, harassing fellow shoppers while she shouts COVID all over them. Another maskless Karen [*“doesn’t give a fuck about these dumbass motherfuckers”*](https://twitter.com/LucianLegacy/status/1276968825163038721) as she throws a tantrum and makes a mess in a grocery store that an essential worker now has to clean up. Oh and there was this maskless Karen that [walked over to other patrons in a coffee shop and coughed on them](https://www.facebook.com/ally.goodbaum/posts/10100595159892075).

Is the average white American really this extreme of a Karen anti-masker, or a [fool that thinks removing “blue states” would lower the COVID-19 death rate](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/9/17/21443658/trump-coronavirus-covid-19-deaths-blue-states), or a COVID conspiracy theorist? Based on available data [I don’t think that is the case](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/27/more-americans-say-they-are-regularly-wearing-masks-in-stores-and-other-businesses/). But it’s clear the average white American does not take COVID seriously, or we wouldn’t still be enduring such an unbelievable amount of excess deaths every single day and hospitals filled to capacity.

Open any internet video of people indoors not wearing a mask, and the internet turns into a debate with white people arguing it’s a personal choice to wear a mask, gleefully ignoring the patriotic & civic duty we have to protect each other. White america believes the death rate is “so low”, they don’t have to care if they get the virus, completely ignoring the fact this line of thinking has led to hospitals filling to capacity, as COVID patients can spend weeks in an ICU, [which in turn means hospitals have to turn patients away](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/10/houston-coronavirus-emergency-rooms/), [especially in rural areas](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/state-and-regional/running-out-of-room-st-louis-hospitals-forced-to-turn-away-patients-from-rural-areas/article_0e17fc93-3e67-5a49-9a33-0b346618b5c3.html), or [build temporary emergency hospital capacity](https://apnews.com/article/new-york-staten-island-coronavirus-pandemic-new-york-city-55f4e7be9b4c07d8279204948959015f). To make everything worse, hundreds of thousands of people have wound up [suffering long-term debilitating effects of the disease](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/long-haulers-covid-19-recognition-support-groups-symptoms/615382/), often known as COVID long haulers, a group of people that are still [poorly understood by the medical community](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/health/covid-long-term-symptoms.html) but are across the spectrum in age and fitness prior to COVID exposure. Alarmingly, many of the effects are [not only physically challenging but also mentally challenging](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/health/coronavirus-mental-health-long-hauler.html), many categorized as having “[brain fog](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html)”. But as this incoming white Republican Congressman brilliantly put it, [*“This looks like a group of people that get that this is a phony pandemic… it's a serious virus, but it's a virus. It's not a pandemic... You get it. You stand up against tyranny...”*](https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-good-called-covid-pandemic-phony-congress-trump-election-rally-2020-12).

<CovidParty />

But my apologies, maybe I’m being too stern about this because white America is just so tired of quarantining. They just had to squeeze in a [massively packed indoor dance party](https://twitter.com/MajorPhilebrity/status/1257685229470461954), or an [indoor Thanksgiving dinner](http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2020/11/12/survey-nearly-2-in-5-americans-will-likely-attend-large-holiday-gatherings/), regardless of how likely it is to lead to [superspreader events that kill people who were not even present at such events](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-a-small-wedding-in-maine-became-a-deadly-covid-19-superspreader). My least favorite episode I recently read about was a groom that had tested positive for COVID the day before the wedding, [but the wedding went on anyway because he didn’t have any symptoms](https://www.texasmonthly.com/being-texan/texas-wedding-photographers-have-seen-some/). We are a year into this pandemic and white people are still refusing to understand the basics of the disease, especially when it inconveniences their special wedding day, regardless of how it might impact the underpaid staff making sure it goes swimmingly. Because at the end of the day, they know it’s fine, white America see’s a President that got the virus and never seemed to take it seriously.

My uncle invited our family to celebrate Christmas eve indoors, seemingly forgetting the pandemic never ended. My aunt asked us to take our masks off at her house. My cousin is never wearing a mask in his Instagram stories. Because in America we value individualism above all-else. Me me me me me. My needs matter more than theirs. *“I don’t care if your grandparents die, I need to live my life”* (I actually read this chilling quote in the comments of the Staten Island Facebook community). America doesn’t run on Dunkin, it runs on individualism.

And ultimately none of us will ever be a perfect collectivist. Maybe I held my breath under my mask and hugged a friend or two this year that I hadn’t seen in months, or enjoyed outdoor dining once with people outside my “bubble”. But the point is we could have tried our best as a nation to win this war, but we didn’t even put up a damn fight. It’s heartbreaking. At the time of writing this, over three hundred thousand Americans have been tragically lost this year due to COVID-19, often dying alone in a hospital, and there are so many white people who just don’t care.

In fact, America cares so little about COVID-19 they have spent this entire pandemic screaming about the audacity of state officials to close businesses in parts of the country where COVID is surging. And of course they have a right to be mad when it’s their livelihoods on the line, but they can’t find it in themselves to be vigorously outraged at the members of Congress who could put an end to all of the economic suffering. I guess that would be too socialist. It’s better to let Jeff Bezos pop a champagne bottle this year for [being the first person ever to crack $200 billion dollars in networth](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-worth-more-than-200-billion.html) while every Amazon warehouse worker chugs along without hazard pay. So instead of demanding “*socialist*” economic redistribution in an economic crisis, white America points their rage at the officials who briefly closed the businesses to save the wider population from unnecessary mass death.

In many ways, this acceptance of mass death by America is no different than how it has accepted & tolerated mass death from gun violence, or how it celebrated George Bush taking up painting after the Iraq war (*and can we take a moment to appreciate that the Joint Chiefs of staff this year called the invasion of Afghanistan a [“modicum of success”](https://taskandpurpose.com/analysis/modicum-of-success-is-the-new-mission-accomplished-for-afghanistan/)?*).

America just doesn’t care when lots of people unnecessarily die.
